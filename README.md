# BANTER APPLICATION
------------------------

Welcome to Banter chat application repository. This is an innovative real-time chat application built with **M**ongoDB, **E**xpress.js, **R**eact and **N**ode.js (MERN) web stack. Banter aims to provide communication for teams and groups.

## Project Information
------------------------
* Motivation: During our specialization track in the ALx Software Developer program, we got a glimpse of different web stacks but didnâ€™t get much hands-on experience with them. We were really interested in learning JavaScript frameworks like React, Node.js, and Express.js. So, we decided to team up and create this application to give ourselves that chance.
